# Data Structure and Algorithmn
 Contains references to learn DSA and coding samples in different languages

> We are computer science students looking to improve our DSA and programming skills. This repository contains resources to learn programming languages and sample coding for different data structure and algorithms

# So, what is this?
This repository serves as a reference for DSA. 

**Main** branch will store concepts and theories on DSA. Refer to **Python** branch for coding in `.py` format, **C++** branch is for coding in `.cpp` format.

# Data Strucutures
## Linked List
It is the fundamental data structure and should be mastered before venturing into other structures. Once this is mastered, you think think of other structures as linked list but with _extra steps_.

![doubly linked list](https://github.com/HairyPotato69/Data-Structure-and-Algorithmn/blob/main/Images/Linked%20list/basic%20linked%20list%20drawing.png)
_doubly linked list_

**Why?**
1. Dynamic data structure
2. Easier to update or delete
3. Memory usage efficiency
4. Implementation of more advanced structures uses linked list

**Composition**
1. Node
   - Data: holds value or data associated with the node
   - Next: holds address of the next node
   - Previous (optional): holds address of the previous node
2. Head: points to the first node in the linked list
3. Tail: points to the final node in the linked list

**Types of linked list**
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular doubly linked list
4. Queue
5. Stack
 
**Basic operations**
1. Inserting values
    - push_front: Adding node to the front of the list
    - push_back: Adding node to the back of the list
    - insert: Adding node to the middle of the list
    - insert: Adding node in an orderly manner, given that the list is in orderly manner
2. Deleting values
   - pop_front: Removing the first node of the list
   - pop_back: Removing the last node of the list
   - remove: Removing the node in the middle of the list (index)
   - remove: Remove the first node that matches the value
3. Retrieving values
   - front: Get value from the first node of the list
   - back: Get value from the final node of the list
   - value_at: Get value from the node in the middle of the list
4. Retrieve node
   - find node: find node based on the index given
5. Reverse: reverses the list
