# Data Structure and Algorithmn
 Contains references to learn DSA and coding samples in different languages

> We are computer science students looking to improve our DSA and programming skills. This repository contains resources to learn programming languages and sample coding for different data structure and algorithms

# So, what is this?
This is to help us practise our DSA skills. 

**Main** branch will store concepts and theories on DSA. Refer to **Python** branch for coding in `.py` format, **C++** branch is for coding in `.cpp` format.
