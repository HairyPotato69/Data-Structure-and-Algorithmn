# Data Structure and Algorithmn
 Contains references to learn DSA and coding samples in different languages

> We are computer science students looking to improve our DSA and programming skills. This repository contains resources to learn programming languages and sample coding for different data structure and algorithms

# So, what is this?
This repository serves as a reference for DSA. 

**Main** branch will store concepts and theories on DSA. Refer to **Python** branch for coding in `.py` format, **C++** branch is for coding in `.cpp` format.

# Data Strucutures
## Linked List
It is the fundamental data structure and should be mastered before venturing into other structures. Once this is mastered, you think think of other structures as linked list but with _extra steps_.

**Composition**
1. Node
   - Data: holds value or data associated with the node
   - Next: holds address of the next node
   - Previous (optional): holds address of the previous node
2. Head: points to the first node in the linked list
3. Tail: points to the final node in the linked list
